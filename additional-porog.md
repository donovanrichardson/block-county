## 2. Suggestions for Additional Progress Indicators

### A. State-Level Progress
- **Add:** Progress bar or counter for states being processed (e.g., "Processing state 2/50: FIPS 56").
- **Benefit:** User sees overall progress when running for multiple states.

### B. County-Level Progress (API Fetch)
- **Add:** Progress bar for counties being fetched (not just per-county records).
- **Benefit:** User sees how many counties are left to fetch.


### G. Summary Table
- **Add:** At the end, print a summary table of all states/counties processed, records inserted, centroids calculated, and any errors.
- **Benefit:** Quick overview of the entire run.
